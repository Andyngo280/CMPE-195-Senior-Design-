# CMPE-195-Senior-Design-
An AR indoor navigation app that showcases a path for users to reach their destination. 

# Install Instruction 
The tests were performed on our iOS mobile devices during the developing stage, but sometimes it can be frustrate to install the app onto iOS devices, and Android devices would be more straight forward. Thus, I would recommend you to install it to Android devices.
In order to install the software on mobile devices, you need to follow the following steps:

# Preparation:
## Install Unity Hub, Xcode, and the project zip file
Link for Unity Hub: 
    for mac: https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.dmg
    for windows: https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe
Link for Xcode 14: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

# For iOS System
You need a mac OS device with xcode installed in order to install it on iOS devices

## 1. Launch Unity

## 2. Change build setting
Navigate to File >> Build Settings...
On the leftside, platform menu, choose iOS, and on the bottom right click Switch Platform to switch the build mode to iOS

## 4. iOS device set up
Connect your iPhone/iPad to your mac device, in settings, navigate to Privacy & Security, at the bottom of the page, turn on Developer Mode 

## 5. Xcode settings
After the project is built, an Xcode project file is generated and should be opened automatically.
On the top menu, choose the build target to be the device you connected with so it will install the software to your connected device.
If there are any warnings or errors, you probably need to fix the signing settings under the team settings.
